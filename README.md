# Python and Flask simple API
A simple Python playground in which I tried to explore Flask basics.

### Note and usage
- Use venv and Python 3.9 (!important)
- Use pip to install Flask

To initialize the DB and run the server:  

` $ python run.py`

You will see the result on: ``` localhost:5000 ```
